# Twine

Twine is a functional, strongly typed Rust framework for composing models and using them to solve problems.

It is designed for engineers and researchers who want to write explicit, correct, and reusable modeling code, and to run that code using generic solvers, optimizers, and transient simulators.

Twine ships with a growing set of ready-to-use domain components (thermal storage, heat exchangers, turbomachinery), thermodynamic property libraries, and shared execution tools.

**Status**: Under active development. Core design is stable, but APIs may change between releases.
