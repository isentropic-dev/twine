/// Trait for creating thermodynamic states from various input combinations.
///
/// This trait allows models to create a `State<Fluid>` from different types
/// of thermodynamic inputs, offering flexibility in how states are specified.
///
/// Common input patterns for [`Stateless`] fluids include tuples such as:
/// - `(ThermodynamicTemperature, MassDensity)` - Direct temperature and density
/// - `(ThermodynamicTemperature, Pressure)` - Temperature and pressure (model calculates density)
/// - `(Pressure, MassDensity)` - Pressure and density (model calculates temperature)
/// - `(Pressure, SpecificEntropy)` - Pressure and entropy (model calculates temperature and density)
///
/// Single values are also supported, such as `ThermodynamicTemperature` alone for
/// incompressible [`Stateless`] fluids, which use the fluid's reference density.
///
/// Models implement this trait for specific `Input` types to indicate which
/// combinations they support.
///
/// A blanket implementation is provided for all [`Stateless`] fluids using
/// `(ThermodynamicTemperature, MassDensity)` as the input.
